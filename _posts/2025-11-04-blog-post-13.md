Starting from today, I will be at Xi'an Jiaotong University for a month, funded by the TNE-LEGO project, to exchange teaching skills and research interests. I will be on the course on "Composite mechanics and application of AI", with specific topics on the impact dynamics of composites and AI-assisted modeling strategies. As for the research works, I will investigate and design the advanced structures for impact resistance. You may find me at Xi'an Jiaotong University.
