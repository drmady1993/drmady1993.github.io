As one of the mandatory courses for students of Mechanical Enginnering. I was one of the teachers for the course from 2021 to 2022. The course aims to provide the students with the necessary tools for the design and assessment of machine components for transportation systems, both under static and fatigue loading. The basics of mechanical design are upgraded in order to include advanced theory of elasticity, finite element analysis, design methods for static and fatigue loads. Theory of elasticity is extended in order to make it possible to evaluate stresses in typical mechanical components like pressure vessels, welded junctions, power transmission shafts, and validate finite element analyses.
