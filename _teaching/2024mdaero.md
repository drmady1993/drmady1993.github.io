As one of the most challenging courses for students of Aerospace Enginnering. I am one of the teachers for the course from 2021 to 2024. The aim of the course is the introduction of the fundamental concepts of design, sizing, assessment of strength and life evaluation of aeronautical components. The study will start with a general description of the different design methods applied for the aeronautical structural elements, focused the attention on the most used mechanical components for aeronautical applications and of the methods on jointing, with the definition of principles and methodologies for its detailed design. In addition, the knowledge related to the mechanical behaviour of materials, with particular attention to the fatigue behaviour, are analysed and the different methods to take it into account are delivered; after this, the main formulation for the structural integrity assessment is shown.
