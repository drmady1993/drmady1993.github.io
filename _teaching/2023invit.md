In the invited lecture, the multiscale modeling strategy of woven composites is introduced, while the damage and failure morphology is involved both numerically and experimentally as validation. On the other hand, the modeling methods to include the strain rate effect of composite materials are introduced with their pros and cons. At the very end, the insights for development of the calculation field are provided.
