As noticed the strain rate effect on the mechanical properties of composite materials, it is of great importance to replicate the strain rate effect for the ballistic simulation. However, the strain-rate-dependent mechanical properties of composites may require great efforts in material testing. Considering the features of composites, making by components, a numerical method was proposed with the strain-rate-dependent mechanical properties of components to predict the strain rate effect on composites through mesoscale modeling, which were then implanted into macroscale modeling and serves for structural level simulations. During this lecture, the numerical methodology at mesoscale level to consider the strain rate effect on fiber and matrix is introduced, where the experimental activities for validating the numerical methodology are included as a reference. With the results from mesoscale modeling, a macroscale modeling to simulate the ballistic behaviors of composites at coupon level with implementations of the strain-rate-dependent mechanical properties as well as the validation of the numerical model through the ballistics tests. In the meanwhile, some numerical issues during the mesoscale and macroscale modeling are delivered for the accuracy-and-efficiency-balanced consideration, while the possible adaptation of the macroscale models towards structural levels is present.
