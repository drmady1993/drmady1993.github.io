This course is a new one opened towards students of Mechanical Engineering with new track of Marine Engineering. As one of the teachers, I am involved to develop the course from 2024 till now and mainly delivered the knowledge on buckling and numerical analysis on large structures. The course is aimed at providing the students with sufficient background to allow their efficient interaction with naval engineers in the definition of inputs and the assessment of the outputs for structural analysis and design of a ship. To this aim, the field of ship structural design and analysis, general definitions and illustration of structural components are introduced. The theoretical concepts and practical instruments for design and analysis of ship structures are delivered. While the most common problems affecting ship operation, from structural point of view, and new trends toward operation and maintenance optimization are illustrated.
