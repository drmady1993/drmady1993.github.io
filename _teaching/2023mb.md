As one of the advanced courses for students of Mechanical Enginnering. I am one of the teachers for the course in 2022. Focused on case studies and topics, the goal of the course is to provide the students with the specifics of the mechanical behaviour of different material classes. Each material is studied considering its own peculiarities in terms of specific constitutive laws, strength and specific life assessment methods under complex stress states. Some material properties are experimentally evaluated, while mechanical behaviour of materials is numerically modelled by adopting the finite element method approach.
