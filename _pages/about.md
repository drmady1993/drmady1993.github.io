I am Dayou Ma, an assistant professor in [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.mecc.polimi.it/en/research/faculty/dayou-ma) at Politecnico di Milano. I strive to uncover the nonlinear, damage and failure mechanical properties of materials under extreme/dynamic conditions.

Biography
======
Dayou Ma has contributed to the investigation of materials under extreme loading conditions, especially composite materials. After getting Master degree in solid mechanics, he earned his PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano ([POLIMI](https://www.polimi.it/)). During PhD, he joined DyMaLab of Ghent University ([UGENT](https://www.ugent.be/en)) as a visiting researcher in 2020. After PhD, he became an Assistant Professor (RTDa) at Department of Mechanical Engineering (POLIMI) in Machine and Vehicle Design till now. During the period, he worked as visiting researcher in many institutions to perform his research activities, including UGENT in 2023 funded by COST Action, Technical Innovation Institution ([TII](https://www.tii.ae/)) in 2024 funded by POLIMI.

Dayou Ma was elected into Early Career Editorial Board of [International Journal of Structural Integrity](https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/issn/1757-9864) in 2024.
Since 2024, he has certificated as an associate professor by ASN (Italian National Scientific Qualification Association)!

Research insights
======
I would like to group ideas and efforts on design and support for structrue design under extreme conditions, including analysis and design in both exeperimental and numerical methods, specific for exploring new numerical methodology for efficiency and high-fidelity calculation for reducing the costs of the experiments.
The research activities cover both numerical and experimental investigations, including but not limited to mechanical responses and fracture behaviours of materials under extreme conditions as well as multifunctional applications of composite materials. My current focuses are dynamic response of polymers and composites under impact loading conditions, stochastic modelling with material uncertainties considered, and the multifunctional modelling of (nano)composites. Besides, I am now trying to transfer my previous numerical/experimental methods for dynamic responses at material level to structural level. ***Any related ideas on it are welcomed!!!***
