CertainPLUS: Uncover the uncertainty effect for thermoplastic composites from manufacture to extreme loading conditions
2024-2025
---

This project aims to modelling the uncertainty founded during manufactrue of thermoplastic composites and its effect on their mechanical performance under impact loading. Numerical method are aplied while the experimental activities are performed for validation.  
_Funded by IDEA League Fellowship_

HISTRATE: advanced composites under high strain rates loading: a route to certification-by-analysis
2023-2026
---

<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>  
The project aims to establish the scientific and technological foundations for the creation and implementation of a reliable and robust framework for the certification by analysis of advanced composite load-bearing structures subject to high strain rate loading. A sub-project was funded with topic "Optimal matrix for composite materials under impact loading conditions" (2023).  
_Funded by COST Action_
